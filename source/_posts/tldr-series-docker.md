There is no need for another Docker introduction, there are plenty out there. To be honest it is even too much and if you just start to learn Docker you can feel lost in this whole pile of Docker related articles. Some of them could be too advanced, some are too specific and it is easily may not be the thing you are looking for. I will prepare you for what you would find in this blog post beforehand. After more then two years have passed that I have started to use Docker I have decided to write a summary of Docker concepts, how it all works together and what is the most important, why we need it. So it is not "101 How to install and setup introduction". In fact I assume that you are already have decent knowledge about Docker, but it is a bit fragmented and you want to put all of the pieces together to see the big picture. I will do the best I can to help you using "in the plain English" kind of explanations. There would be something interesting also for those who want to understand how Docker works under the hood.
